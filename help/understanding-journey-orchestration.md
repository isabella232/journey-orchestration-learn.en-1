## How to configure a journey

The main steps in preparation for building journeys are:

1. [Configure Streaming Events](/help/configuring-journey-orchestration/configure-streaming-events.md) - This configuration is mandatory, as [!UICONTROL Journey Orchestration] is designed to listen to events.
1. [Configure Data Sources](/help/configuring-journey-orchestration/configure-data-sources.md) - This configuration is not required if your journeys only use local data coming from an event payload.
1. [Configure Custom Actions](/help/configuring-journey-orchestration/configure-actions.md): Required if you want to use a service from any 3rd party provider that can be called through a [!DNL REST API] with a JSON formatted payload

>[!NOTE]
>
>These configuration steps require technical knowledge. You must be familiar with the [Experience Data Model (XDM)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/schemas/schemas-and-experience-data-model.html?lang=en) and [how to compose XDM experience event schemas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/schemas/create-schemas.html?lang=en).
